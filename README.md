# WeBots Robotics Simulation for different tasks.

Robot Controllers coded in python and simulated in Webots.

Lab 5

The main goal of Lab 5 is to provide practical knowledge and hands-on experience in the area of
robotic mapping and path planning. The lab session is centered around two primary objectives:
Wall Mapping: This assignment entails utilizing a robot to dynamically determine the complete
interior wall layout of a maze. The task is to precisely chart the layout of the maze surroundings
without any prior information about the positions of the walls.
Path planning involves the creation and execution of algorithms to find the most efficient route
between specified starting and ending locations within a mapped environment.

Lab 4

The goal of this lab is to get hands-on experience in probabilistic robot localization through the
utilization of techniques such as trilateration, triangulation, and wall-based localization.
Task 1 required the identification of certain landmarks by utilizing trilateration or triangulation. I
devised a plan to determine the precise location of the robot by utilizing the placements of familiar
landmarks which were yellow, blue, red, and green cylinders bound by the walls and at corner of
them. Task 2 concentrated on wall-based localization, wherein I tried to calculate localization
approximations for every grid cell using the preexisting map of the surroundings.

Lab 3

In order for a robot to travel to a goal while avoiding obstacles, the primary objectives of this lab
are to develop motion planning algorithms for the robot. To be more specific, we concentrate on
Task 1: Motion to goal, in which the robot is tasked with reaching a yellow cylinder, and Task 2:
Bug Zero Algorithm, in which the robot must navigate around obstacles to achieve the objective by
utilizing the Bug Zero algorithm.

Lab 2

The purpose of this lab was to develop a PID controller that would allow a robot to move in a
parallel direction to a wall and come to a stop at a distance that was specified from an end wall. An
additional objective of the laboratory was to to integrate distance sensors, Lidar technology, and
PID controls for wall following based on the given input of either to follow the right wall or to
follow the left wall.

Lab 1

The purpose of this lab is to perform robot kinematics and how to apply them to motion control.
The lab specifically concentrates on calculating the movement of robots for navigating through
certain waypoints, using encoders to receive information about the speed at which the wheels are
rotating, and incorporating IMUs to measure the robot's rotation angles around the z-axis (yaw).
